            I'm a social, ambitious and driven university student with excellent
            problem-solving skills. I'm a fourth-year Computer Science and
            Engineering student currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s Degree in
            Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

        <h1>About me.</h1>
        <p>
          Before I embarked on my journey into the world of Computer Science and
          Engineering, I was already exploring the realm of technology and
          software development. My early experiences led me to delve into IT,
          Engineering, and Software Development, honing my problem-solving
          skills and laying the foundation for my current pursuit of a Master's
          Degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          My side projects have become a playground for my curiosity, allowing
          me to stay on the cutting edge of emerging technologies and the
          ever-evolving digital landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the realm of technology, I find joy in the simple pleasures of
          life. Whether it's skiing down big mountains, working out, sipping a
          warm cup of coffee, or spending quality time with friends. Just like
          the intricate web of code, life's experiences continue to shape me,
          and I eagerly anticipate what lies ahead in this ever-exciting
          journey.
